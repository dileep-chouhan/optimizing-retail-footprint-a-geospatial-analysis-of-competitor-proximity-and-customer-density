# Optimizing Retail Footprint: A Geospatial Analysis of Competitor Proximity and Customer Density

## Overview

This project performs a geospatial analysis to identify optimal locations for new retail stores and suggest improvements to existing store portfolios.  The analysis leverages geospatial data to assess competitor proximity, customer density, and predict potential sales uplift for various scenarios.  The results provide actionable insights for strategic retail planning and expansion.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas (and other relevant geospatial libraries - specify if used)

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that all necessary data files (e.g., CSV files containing store locations, customer demographics) are located in the appropriate directory as specified within the code.*

## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the geospatial analysis to the console, including summaries of competitor proximity, customer density scores, and predicted sales uplift for different scenarios.  Additionally, the analysis will generate several visualization files (e.g., maps showing store locations, competitor density heatmaps, sales uplift projections).  These output files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `competitor_heatmap.png`) will be saved in the `output` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist).  The specific output files and their formats may vary depending on the analysis performed.


## Data

The project requires specific data files. Please ensure these files are present in the `data` directory before running the analysis.  Detailed information about the required data format and content is available within the code's documentation.
